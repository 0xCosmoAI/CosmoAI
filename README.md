# ZerePy

We're building ZerePy, an open-source Python framework designed to let you deploy your own agents on X, powered by 
OpenAI or Anthropic LLMs.

ZerePy is built from a modularized version of the Zerebro backend. With ZerePy, you can launch your own agent with 
similar core functionality as Zerebro. For creative outputs, you'll need to fine-tune your own model.
